## About

Undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo. 

## Research Interests

For my thesis, I am studying how individuals remember and use language, exploring whether embedding meaningful information, like personal experiences or familiar characteristics, improves memory retention. This led me to the research question for my Honours Thesis: How do visual proximity and semantic context influence adults’ ability to identify newly learned objects?"
