## About

Undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo

## Research Interests

I am interested in studying memory and researching whether meaningful information (i.e personal anecdotes) enhances the ability to remember. This led me to the research question for my Honours Thesis: How do visual proximity and semantic context influence adults’ ability to identify newly learned objects?"
